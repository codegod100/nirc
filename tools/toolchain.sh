# One archive — Nim — pinned by version and by sha256, unpacked into
# `.toolchain/`, and put on a PATH. That is the whole of it. No nix, no image,
# no devShell: a checkout plus this script is a machine that can build any
# target here, and the same script is what the Modal containers run.
#
# It used to fetch Flutter too, which carried Dart, and before that a JDK,
# the Clojure CLI and an Android SDK. The app is Nim from the state to the
# pixels now — nimkit paints it, on GTK and in a page — so Nim is all of it.

# The pins. A version and its hash, and nothing derived at run time: a

# Nim, for `nim/` — the portable core. Upstream's prebuilt linux_x64 tarball,
# so there is no bootstrap compile here. The core deliberately has no
# dependencies outside Nim's standard library, so the compiler is all of it.
#
# Two things Nim wants from the host rather than from here: a C compiler,
# because `nim c` shells out to one, and OpenSSL, because `-d:ssl` in
# nim/nim.cfg makes std/net resolve -lssl and -lcrypto through dynlib at run
# time. A missing libssl is a SIGSEGV in `newContext` that says nothing about
# SSL, which is why require_host_tools checks for cc up front.
