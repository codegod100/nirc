## Tab in the compose box: the word at the caret, completed.
##
## `members.completeNick` is the one-shot rule — one match whole, several as
## far as they agree. This is the same rule with a memory, which is what lets
## a second Tab mean something: once the matches agree no further, Tab walks
## through them one at a time, and Shift-Tab walks back.
##
## The memory is the draft and the caret as Tab left them. Anything the
## reader does in between — a letter typed, the caret moved — makes the next
## Tab a fresh completion of whatever word is under the caret now.
