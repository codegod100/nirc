## Message text as alternating text and link runs.
##
## From the bottom of `common/nirc/screens/chat.cljc`. Pulled into a module of
## its own because it is the one part of that screen that is pure string
## work, and it is the part most worth testing on its own.
##
## Runs because a link has to be styled and clickable on its own. They are
## laid out as one inline row — a paragraph — rather than stacked: stacking
## gave every link a line of its own, and a plain wrapping row measures each
## label against the row's width rather than the column's, which is what
## drags long URLs off the left edge.
