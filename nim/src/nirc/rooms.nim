## The conversation list, and the read marker under it.
##
## Transcribed from `common/nirc/rooms.cljc`. Pure functions over the state —
## everything here is a question about rooms rather than a change to one, with
## the exceptions (`markRead`, `markAllRead`, `ensureRoom`) that are named
## for being changes.
##
## The marker is the part to read carefully. Unread is *derived* from it and
## never counted, because a count cannot survive what the server does: a JOIN
## replays the backlog and CHATHISTORY replays it again, and every line would
## tick a counter a second time. Against a marker a replayed line is simply
## older than it and counts for nothing.

    ##
    ## A room joined for the first time replays its whole history, and none of
    ## that is news — the reader was not away for it, they were not here. So a
    ## new buffer starts caught up rather than at the beginning, or joining a
    ## busy channel announces a hundred unread posts from before you arrived.
    ##
    ## A minute ago rather than this instant, because a live line is stamped
    ## by the server and this by our clock: the two disagree by whatever the
    ## skew is, and a live message stamped a few seconds behind us would land
    ## under the marker and never be counted. A minute is more skew than there
    ## will be and far less than the age of any backlog. What it costs is that
    ## a message sent in the minute before you joined counts as unread, which
    ## is the harmless direction.

  ## arrives new on every rejoin, appended again and stamped now, which is a
  ## room that can never be finished reading. What it does have is a sender
  ## and words, which for an untagged line is identity enough. The cost is
  ## that the same person saying the same thing twice — both untagged — shows
