## A `draft/multiline` batch, put back together into the one message it is.
##
## A server sends a message with line breaks in it as a batch: an opener that
## carries the message's tags (msgid, time, account, signature), one PRIVMSG
## per line carrying nothing but `batch=<id>`, and a closer. It does this in a
## CHATHISTORY replay as well, nested inside the history batch.
##
## Without the capability it sends the fallback instead — the same lines with
## the tags on the first only — and a reader that takes each line on its own
## gets rows with no msgid (so no reply or react), no account (so no face) and
## no time. The last is the worst of them: an untimed line is stamped with the
## moment it arrived, so a replayed paragraph sorts below everything and sits
## at the bottom of the room as though it were the newest thing said.
##
## So the client asks for the batch, and this hands the reducer one PRIVMSG
## with the opener's tags and the lines joined, as though it had come as one.
## Everything else passes straight through.
