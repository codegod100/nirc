## The widget tree Nim hands Dart, and the little DSL for building one.
##
## The shape is the hiccup the ClojureDart screens already produce — a tag, a
## props table, children — because the vocabulary is the part worth keeping.
## `nirc.hiccup` interprets exactly these tags into Flutter widgets today, so a
## tree emitted here and a tree emitted there describe the same screen, and
## the renderer on the Dart side is the same idea rewritten rather than a new
## one invented.
##
## The one real difference is callbacks. In Clojure a prop holds a closure;
## across a C ABI it cannot, so `onClick` holds an **event id** instead — an
## opaque string Dart sends back to `dispatch`. That is what turns this from a
## rendering trick into an architecture: Nim owns the state, Dart owns the
## pixels, and the only things crossing are a tree going out and an event id
## coming back.
