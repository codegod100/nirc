## A line in the compose box that starts with `/`: a command, not something
## said.
##
## Parsed here and carried out in `reducer`, because what a command *is* is a
## question about a string and what it *does* is a question about the
## connection. This half has no state and no socket, so it is tested on its
## own.
##
## `//` escapes the slash: `//shrug` is the line `/shrug`, said. And a
## command this client does not know is not refused but sent as it was typed,
## uppercased — `/whois alice` is `WHOIS alice` — which is what every IRC
## client has done since there were IRC clients.
