## A transport, and nothing above it.
##
## This is `nirc.net`'s three operations — connect, send, close — with a socket
## and a TLS context behind them. It knows about lines; it does not know about
## IRC, about a state machine, or about a screen.
##
## That boundary is the whole point of this module existing separately from
## `irc.nim`. The spike had Nim owning the state and the screens, which meant
## reimplementing screens that already exist and are far better — 1,518 lines
## of chat with reactions, replies and images, against forty lines of
## facsimile. Wiring Nim in *under* `nirc.net` instead leaves every screen, the
## cells they read and the actions they call exactly where they are, and
## replaces only the part that was always platform code.
##
## Threading as before: the socket thread shares nothing, and speaks in
## channels. See irc.nim's comment for why ORC makes that the sane choice.
