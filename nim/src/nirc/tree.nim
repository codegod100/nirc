## The screen the state says, as the JSON a host paints — built only when
## something it is built from has changed.
##
## Both hosts ask for this on a timer, ten times a second, because nothing
## calls into them when a line arrives. Building it every time was cheap in
## C and was not in a browser: a busy room is half a megabyte of tree, and
## under `nim js` building it, stringifying it and handing it over as a
## JavaScript string was about a quarter of a second — more than the timer's
## whole period, so the page never had an idle moment to take a keystroke in.
##
## So the state the last tree came from is kept, and an unchanged state gets
## the same JSON back. A whole-state comparison rather than a flag every
## mutation has to remember to set: a missed flag is a screen that does not
## move, and this cannot miss one.
