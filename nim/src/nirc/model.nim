## What a message and a room are.
##
## The types the rest of the port hangs off, transcribed from the shapes
## `nirc.cells` holds and `nirc.rooms` reads. Kept as one module because they
## are one idea: a room is a list of messages and the bookkeeping about how
## far it has been read.
##
## Fields that are `Option` in spirit are spelled as a value plus a `has`
## flag rather than `Option[T]`, for one reason: these cross the FFI as JSON,
## and a missing key and a null key are the same thing on the other side. An
## Option would have to be unwrapped at every boundary anyway.
