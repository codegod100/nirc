## The IRC wire format, as text. No socket, no host, no platform.

## A transcription of `common/nirc/irc/parse.cljc`, which stays where it is
## until the Dart binding for this has been proven against it — see
## ../../README.md. The rules here are IRCv3's and the comments explaining
## *why* a rule is fiddly are kept from the original rather than rewritten,
## because they record bugs that were actually paid for.

type
  IrcLine* = object
    ## An IRC line, taken apart. `raw` is what actually arrived, kept so a
    ## reader can say that rather than what we made of it — a tag the server
    ## dropped is invisible in every other field.
    raw*: string
    tags*: string        ## "" where the line carried none
    hasTags*: bool       ## distinguishes no tags at all from an empty "@ "

  ## `\:` is a semicolon, `\s` a space, and `\\`, `\r` and `\n` themselves —
  ## the escaping exists because `;` separates tags and a space ends them. It
  ## matters for any value that can contain either: a reaction tally is
  ## `emoji:nick;emoji:nick` on the wire and arrives with every one of those
  ## semicolons written `\:`, so a reader that skips this step sees one tally
  ## where there were three, and counts to match.

  ## One pass rather than the original's five chained replaces, which is not
  ## an optimisation but a correctness fix waiting to happen: replacing `\`

  ## order, and a sixth rule inserted in the wrong place would double-escape.

  ## form fell through as absent and the empty one came back as "". A caller
  ## asks whether a fact is there, and an empty string is a fact that is
  ## there — which is how a `+reply=` on a line answering nothing put a reply
  ## chip above it, pointing at a message no id could find.

  ## So an empty value reads as absent, exactly as the Clojure did through
  ## `not-empty`. The bool is that answer; the string is meaningless when it
