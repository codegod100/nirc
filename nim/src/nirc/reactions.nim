## Emoji pills: the tally, and folding one change into a buffer.
##
## From `common/nirc/reactions.cljc`. The tally is a seq of `Reaction` rather
## than a map so the pills keep their order — a map would have thrown away
## the order they are drawn in, and the Clojure gets away with it only because
## its map happens to preserve insertion for small maps.
