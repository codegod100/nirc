## Tracing, on when `NIRC_TRACE` is set.
##
## The same switch the rest of nirc uses — README.md documents `NIRC_TRACE=1`
## for the IRC lines — because a second convention for a second language is a
## thing to remember rather than a thing to use.
##
## To stderr and not stdout: stdout is a bundle's own, and a Flutter app on
## Linux prints to the terminal it was launched from. `just nim-app run`
## shows these inline.
##
## Cheap when off. The check is a `let` read once at load rather than a getEnv
## per call, and every `trace` call site guards on it before doing any of the
## string building — which matters because the argument to a trace call is
## usually the expensive part.
