## Server time, in the reader's own zone.
##
## Transcribed from `common/nirc/clock.cljc`, arithmetic and all. The date
## conversions are Howard Hinnant's algorithms rather than a call into a date
## library, which is what let the Clojure version be shared between two
## compilers and is just as useful here: eleven lines with no dependency and
## no zone database.
##
## The zone itself is the one thing that is not arithmetic. `localOffsetSeconds`
## asks the host, because finding it is four platform-specific guesses on Linux
## and one property read on Android — and an offset rather than a zone name
## because the offset moves twice a year, and a backlog read in November
## carries messages from August.
