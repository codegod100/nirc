## The transport, in a browser.
##
## The same three operations `nirc/conn` has on a desktop — connect, send,
## close — and the same two queues the reducer drains. What is different is
## who owns the socket: there, two threads and an OpenSSL connection to
## :6697; here, a WebSocket in JavaScript, because a browser cannot open a
## TCP socket. IRCv3's WebSocket transport is one IRC line per frame, SASL and
## all, and most modern ircds serve it.
##
## So nothing here dials anything. The host calls `feed` with each line that
## arrives and `event` when the socket opens or closes, and takes what this
## queues with `tryOutbound`. Those two are not new: they were added so the
## reducer's answer to a line could be tested without a socket, and a browser
## is the same problem — something else owns the I/O.
