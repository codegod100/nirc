## Telling a signal apart from a failure.
##
## Nothing in this suite raises a real EINTR — a test binary has no signals
## worth the name, which is exactly why the app hit this and the tests never
## did. So the errors here are built by hand, and what is checked is the
## judgement: which ones are retried, which are not, and that a retry gives up
## rather than spinning.
