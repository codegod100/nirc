// The service worker, written the other way round from the one we removed.
//
// A browser will not offer to install a page unless it has a worker with a
// fetch handler, so a PWA needs one. Flutter ships such a worker and it is
// the wrong one here: it is offline-first, which means a deploy landed only
// after a new worker had waited for every tab on the origin to close, and
// until then the app went on serving the bundle it had. Twice in one
// afternoon a working fix read as broken because of it.
//
// This one is network-first and takes over at once.
//
// * `skipWaiting` in install and `clients.claim` in activate: no waiting
//   room. A new worker replaces the old one on the next load, not on the
//   next time every tab happens to be closed.
// * every GET goes to the network first, and the cache is what answers when
//   the network does not. So what is served is what was deployed, and the
//   cache is a fallback rather than the source of truth.
//
// What that buys on the install side is the shell: opened from a home
// screen with no connection it draws itself and says it is not connected,
// rather than showing the browser's dinosaur. It cannot do more than that
// and should not pretend to -- this is a window onto a live IRC connection,
// and without the network there is nothing to look at.
